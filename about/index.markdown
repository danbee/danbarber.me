Hi, my name is Dan Barber. I'm a web designer and developer in London. I design and build standards compliant websites that are simple, usable and attractive using open source software technologies.

My chosen web technology is Ruby on Rails, and I love creating beautiful and usable applications. I currently work for [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com).

If you wish to contact me, you can do so at [hello@danbarber.me](mailto:hello@danbarber.me). You can also download [my GPG key](/danbarber.gpg).
