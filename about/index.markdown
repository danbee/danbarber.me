Hi, my name is Dan Barber. I'm a web designer and developer in London. I design and build standards compliant websites that are simple, usable and attractive using open source software technologies.

My chosen web technology is Ruby on Rails, and I love creating beautiful and usable interfaces. I currently work for [New Bamboo](http://new-bamboo.co.uk).
