In light of Google's recent announcement that they will be [shuttering Reader (among other things)](http://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html) I've decided that it's time to move away from Gmail and reduce my reliance on any services provided by Google.

<!-- more -->

In light of this the first step has been to start moving things over to my own domain, hosted currently on Google Apps for Domains. This gives me the portability I'll need to move to a different email provider.

The next step will be to find a good hosted email service that I can pay for. [Fastmail](http://fastmail.fm) looks like the best option so far so I'll be evaluating that and others, although I'd prefer to host somewhere in the UK.

One of the things that hosting my own domain makes possible is the use of site specific email addresses. For example, for Dropbox one might use dropbox@mydomain.com instead of the usual name@mydomain.com. This has the advantage of easy filtering, and also makes it possible to track down the source of spam emails and potential block them in the future. The only downside I've come across so far is sites that use Gravatar for avatar pictures.
