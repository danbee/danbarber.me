Ok, I know there has been very little in the way of updates here lately.  That's mainly because my personal life has kinda gotten in the way of everything else lately (and no, details are not forthcoming here I'm afraid).

In other news, I'm now giving serious thought to moving this site over to <a href="">Wordpress</a>.  Partly because of the new <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/get_movable_type_personal.shtml">MovableType licensing</a>, and partly because it's PHP based, rather than Perl.  And having played with it a bit, I certainly am quite taken with it.
