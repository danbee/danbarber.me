When are you planning to fix this?

For anybody that's interested this is what happens when Firefox tries to restore windows and tabs when using an authenticating proxy server. If I didn't have the master password set you'd simply see just as many proxy authentication dialogue boxes instead.

*Edit*: I believe, as of Firefox 3.6.2, that this bug has been fixed.
