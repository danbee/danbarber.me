Hot on the heels of version 0.3 comes version 0.4!  New things in this version include:

* New metadata based browse mode (Artist -> Album -> Track).
* Menu now highlights the page you are on.
* Add and Play buttons now recurse the file tree (Be careful with this one if you've got a large library!).

Get it from the <a href="/neompc">NeoMPC page</a>.
