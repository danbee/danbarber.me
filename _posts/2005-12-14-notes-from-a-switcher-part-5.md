Since buying my Powerbook 6 months ago, I can't help feeling that Apple products are currently a bit form over function.  Don't get me wrong--I love my Powerbook, and the Mac OS is well designed, slick and easy to use--but it often seems as though features that might seem fundamental in other apps are just left out, perhaps because they want to sell you a 'Pro' version with that feature and many others (Quicktime is one good example) or just because said feature ruins the lines of the suit, as it were.

<!-- more -->

iPhoto is one such application that appears to have features missing, mainly the ability to view photos full screen (without running a slideshow), and I've also noticed that the photo order within a slideshow reflects the order you have them displayed in thumbnail view so if, like me, you like to see the latest photos at the top, your slideshows will run in reverse chronological order, with no apparent way to change this.

iTunes lacks the ability to play most of my music by default--although the XiphQT component is coming along nicely (missing some metadata stuff at the moment)--and doesn't do gapless playback, which means that mix albums and any other albums that have tracks running into each other end up with little gaps in the music.  Quite annoying.  There also doesn't seem to be any way of sorting albums in the browser by any other criteria than album name.  I'd prefer to sort my albums chronologically.

On the good news front, I've found a solution to the mouse acceleration problem in the form of <a href="http://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/">SteerMouse</a>.  This handy little replacement mouse driver allows me to tune the acceleration or even turn it off, which is what I did.  The bad news is that it costs $20, but I'll be paying that $20 without too much complaint because I can now use my Bluetooth mouse properly.  Do you think I could send the bill on to Apple?
