Well, I've only just got here and I've already been having problems with the site.  The Apache service on the server I'm on kept dying and so the site was unavailable for quite some time.  A quick check of the <a href="http://forums.asmallorange.com/">ASO forums</a> revealed that it was a side effect of so many people moving in onto the newest server.

I'm going to give ASO the benefit of the doubt for now and see how it pans out over the week.
