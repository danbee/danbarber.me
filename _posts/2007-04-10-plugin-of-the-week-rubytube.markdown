*"RubyTube is a real time, digital tube amp simulator. RubyTube simulates the saturation effect that can be found in audio equipment with vacuum tubes. This effect is usually hardly noticable but it is responsible for the classic tube sound. Sometimes its just a sparkle on the voice and a slight compression of drums and bass that makes the difference between a neutral recording and a warm and full sounding song."*

RubyTube is a lovely subtle effect and is great for adding that analogue tube 'grit' to a track. I've found it especially effective on drum tracks, bass tracks and vocal tracks.
