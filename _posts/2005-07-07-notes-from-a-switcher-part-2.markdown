I've been using my Powerbook for about 3 weeks now, and I'm enjoying it immensely.  The OS is slick and quite intuative, although coming from Windows I've had quite a lot to get used to!  The overall experience has so far been very positive.

I can't quite decide which browser to use; the choices being Safari, Firefox and Camino so far.  Safari is nice from an OS integration point of view, and the RSS features work well.  I've been used to Firefox on Windows and as such it feels very familiar on OS X but still well integrated.  Camino lies somewhere in between, with the same wonderful rendering engine as Firefox and an excellent Cocoa interface it would seem the perfect choice, but I can't quite let go of Firefox!

Networking just works.  The Airport Extreme card just picked up my Netgear router and I was browsing the Net within minutes.  I was able to set up WEP encryption with very little hassle, more than can be said for the Netgear Wireless card in my girlfriends laptop!

There are two programs I miss so far though.  On Windows I use Foobar2000 for music playback, and so far there is nothing comparable on OS X.  I've been using iTunes (which is great for making AAC files to play on the mobile phone), but unfortunately lacks the ability to play most of my music collection, which is encoded in Ogg Vorbis.  Cog fills the gap quite nicely at the moment although it's a little bit feature free right now it does play my music and does so gaplessly.

The other program I'm having difficulty finding a replacement for is TextPad.  I think text editors are very much a matter of personal taste and it may be that I just have to get used to something a bit different.
