Joe Kraus:

> I want to ask people a simple question: are you happy with your relationship with your phone. Do you think it’s a healthy one?

> I don’t think I have a healthy relationship with mine. I feel a constant need to pull it out – to check email, to text, to see if there is something interesting happening RIGHT NOW. It’s constantly pulling on my attention.

Great article. I've begun to notice this with myself and my wife. Might have to implement the "no phone" Sunday.
