I've decided that since I seem to be spending rather a lot of time searching for good free VST's, I'd share the fruits of my search with the world.  All the plugins I'll pick for this feature will be plugins that I actually use.

First up is [Majken's Chimera synth][chimeralink].

[![Majken's Chimera][chimeraimage]][chimeralink]

*"Chimera is a noise driven synth focusing on pads and haunting leads. Three noisegenerators are connected through pitchcontrolled resonant bandpass filters. The result is an angelic and smooth synth."*

This synth is capable of some lovely organic, haunting sounds which are ideal for ambient atmospheric tracks. I've spent quite a bit of time just playing with sounds from my keyboard!
