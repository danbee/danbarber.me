The <a href="http://www.artlebedev.com/portfolio/optimus/">Optimus Keyboard</a> is a keyboard in which every key has it's own little LCD display, which means that each key can show exactly which function it will invoke when pressed.  It can show any keyboard layout - such as qwerty or Dvorak, Russian or French - or it can show tool shortcuts for Photoshop or key layout for a game.  It also has a group of ten configurable buttons to the left of the main keys.

I think it's a fantastic idea and would probably buy one in an instant.
