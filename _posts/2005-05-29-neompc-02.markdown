NeoMPC 0.2 is now available for <a href="http://neompc.googlecode.com/files/neompc-0.2.tar.bz2">download</a>.  This is the first release of my <a href="http://www.pixelhum.com/archives/2005-05-12/pocket-mpd-client/"><acronym title="Music Player Daemon">MPD</acronym> Client</a> which is designed for a small screen device like a <acronym title="Personal Digital Assistant">PDA</acronym> or a mobile phone (although it's taylored specifically for a screen 240 pixels wide, I might change it in the future to be a little more flexible).

<em><strong>Update</strong>: NeoMPC now has it's <a title="NeoMPC" href="/neompc/">own page</a>.</em>

You'll need to be running Apache or Apache2 with <acronym title="PHP Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> 4 (It's developed on <acronym title="PHP Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> 4.3.10 but 4+ should be fine) on your <acronym title="Music Player Daemon">MPD</acronym> server.  Running it should be as simple as extracting it to the apache directory (or other web server accessible directory) and navigating to it with your browser.

Use this command to extract the archive.
