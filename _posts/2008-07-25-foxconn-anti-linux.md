While I don't agree with the way the guy handled this (telling them they suck and their products are 'filth' is *not* the way forward), the idea that a [motherboard manufacturer is deliberately screwing with Linux support](http://ubuntu-virginia.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=869249) is quite scary.

Makes you wonder if someone is paying them...
