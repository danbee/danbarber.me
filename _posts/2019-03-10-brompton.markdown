I've coveted the Brompton folding bike for a few years now, and finally decided
to get myself one after find more and more badly maintained Citibikes. It's
a fantastic piece of engineering and great fun to ride. It's also a real head
turner, especially when folding or unfolding the bike!

Mine is an S6L Nickel Edition. S means sporty flat handlebars, 6 means it has
six gears; three on a wide range Sturmey Archer hub and two on a little
derailleur system, and the L means it has mud guards. The six speed setup works
surprisingly well, and the mud guards keep all the muck off my back. The nickel
finish was expensive but looks stunning and is very hard wearing.

It's a surprisingly fast ride, and it is very lively due to the small wheels,
but never feels sketchy at speed. I'm loving it so far!
