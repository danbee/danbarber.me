I'm now running my very own Hackintosh! It was a relatively easy install, with just a few tweaks required to get the graphics card working correctly. I had to come to terms with the fact that there were no working drivers for my onboard LAN adapter (nForce 570) and get a PCI Gigabit card. The Netgear GA311 is a good choice.
