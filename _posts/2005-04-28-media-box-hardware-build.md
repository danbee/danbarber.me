Well, the parts for my media box project arrived last week so I spent the weekend putting it together and configuring Ubuntu Linux to perform media box type duties.  The Software side is far from complete, but the machine build went smoothly and is documented here.

Here's all the components laid out on the table, ready:

I listed the components on a previous post but I'll list them again here:

</ul>
So without further ado, let's get this machine together...

First the harddisk will be installed, I didn't get enough pictures of this, but basically there is a tray in the bottom of the case that catches on one side and is secured with a couple of screws on the other.  Space at the plug end is a little bit limited, especially considering the way the IDE cable is wired into the plug, but it went in fine with no real difficulty.

And from another angle:

This shot shows one of the fans nicely.  It's not the quietest of fans, although there is very little motor noise therefore it's not particularly annoying.

The next thing to go in is the Mainboard.  That was easy enough, the four risers that the board requires are already installed in the case so all we need to do is fit the backplane and screw the board down:

You can see some IDE cable origami going on already where I've connected up the harddisk.  I actually managed to connect it to the secondary IDE channel, not that it mattered really and it made wiring up both drives a little easier.  I've also connected the ATX power connector and the front panel connectors to the mainboard, although the case only has connectors for power LED, HDD LED and power switch.

The last thing to go in is the DVD/CDRW drive.  This screws into a frame that fits in the top part of the case.  Two things I had to be careful of here; the screws that hold the drive in place are very small, and very easy to lose, as I almost discovered! Also, it's a bit tricky getting the drive properly lined up with the front of the case.

You can see more IDE cable origami where I had to cunningly fold the DVD drive IDE cable to get it to fit, and to get the plug the correct way round for the drive.

It's a bit packed in there!  This shot shows you how I had to fold the IDE cable to fit.

Now everything is in, I can put the lid on, and relax with a glass of red wine:

As you can see I wasted no time getting Ubuntu onto it!  I'll post another article later detailing the software setup I use.
