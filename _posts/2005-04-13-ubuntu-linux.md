I've recently discovered and have been playing around with <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org">Ubuntu Linux</a>, more specifically, <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/504Released">Ubuntu 5.04 "Hoary Hedgehog"</a>.  A Debian based distribution, Ubuntu aims to be an excellent desktop distribution and also, being based on Debian, is excellent for use as a server OS.

First impressions are extremely favourable.  In fact, I replaced an old Debian install on a server in the office with an install of Ubuntu!

If I ever convert to Linux on the desktop, this will probably be the distro I go for.
