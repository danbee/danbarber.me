It's been quite a while now since I last posted, and much has happened over the last 12 months. We've moved to a new city and started new jobs.

<!-- more -->

I've been working for a Ruby on Rails consultancy in London called [New Bamboo](http://www.new-bamboo.co.uk) for nearly 12 months now, and it's been excellent. The people I work with are awesome and I'm learning new things every day. I'm also finding opportunities to teach others which is great, and I fully intend to do more of it.

Wifey finally moved up to London three weeks ago, and is now working for a communications consultancy in Westminster.

Spending nearly 12 months apart has been difficult, and I can't recommend it. Unfortunately circumstances dictated that things couldn't happen any faster.

Anyway, the plan is that this post will mark a new commitment to updating this blog on a regular basis. I've said that before but I mean it this time! I have a series of CSS articles in the works so expect something useful within the next few weeks.

Now, I'm off to play some Tomb Raider.
