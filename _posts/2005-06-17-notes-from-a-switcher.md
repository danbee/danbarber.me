Well, I'm sitting here with my shiny new PowerBook on my lap, typing this entry.  So far the experience has been good.  The machine itself is a great example of minimalist design, and consequently it's sleek and very functional.

The OS is quite fantastic.  To someone coming from Windows it's a breath of fresh air.  Windows fly around the screen in drop shadowed, translucent glory and the Dashboard and Expos√© makes things woosh around the screen in a wonderful way.

It's not without issues however.  The keyboard layout is slightly different and the mouse only has one button, but that's something I'll get used to.  The biggest problem so far is the mouse acceleration.  I hate it.  I want my mouse pointer to follow the mouse 1:1 all the time, only I can't seem to find a way to turn it off or even tune it.  Maybe it's something I'll get used to, but to be honest I don't want to.  It's the way I've used mice from the start and I don't really want to change now.

So, If anybody knows of any way to turn off the mouse acceleration in OS X, please let me know.  It'll be appreciated.  It'll be appreciated more if it's free!
