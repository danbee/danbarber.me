As Brooks says in <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/">The Shawshank Redemption</a></em>:

<blockquote>"The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry"</blockquote>

It was while walking to the shop this lunch time that I came to the realisation that we all really are in a big damn hurry all the time.  I myself was striding quickly in order that I had enough time to make my sandwich and get back to work.  The amount I do in a week is really quite scary (besides going to work and sleeping), and I know I'm not the only one.  What is it about our society these days that makes us fill all our available time, leaving none for the important things like just sitting, and contemplating life?  I personally can't remember the last time I just had a moment to sit and look at the waves in the sea, or watch the sun go down, and I miss it.

So, on this note, wouldn't it be a good idea for us all to make a concerted effort to make time for the contemplative mind?
