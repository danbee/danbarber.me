This mix is now starting to sound like a record to my ears! Tonight I concentrated on tying everything together better and using automation to add some dynamics to the mix.

Somebody in the Mix thread pointed out that the top snare drum track was clipped. I hadn't actually noticed, but I did think it sounded a bit rough, so my first task was to fix that using my favourite audio editor. This produced a much better sounding snare track and I used PSP Springverb (a Computer Music freebie) to give it some life. While I was on drums I also muted the toms where they weren't being played. This cleaned up the drum track nicely.

I created a set of buss tracks so I could group together instuments for automation (drums, drum overheads, guitars, bass, vocals and backing vocals).

Then I listened to the track and added in the automation where I felt it was needed, using it to bring up the guitars during the choruses, and drop them out a little during the quieter parts of the track. I used it on the vocals to stop them getting lost with the guitars, and also to help parts of words from getting lost in the mix too. I brought the backing vocals up for the outro to really bring the track to a big close.

You might also notice that this mix is quieter. I was running it quite hot before with the W1 limiter on the main buss, but I've dropped the level back so it's not hitting the ceiling anymore. I think it sounds better that way.
