Well, I've had the iPhone 4 for about 3 weeks now, so I can write a bit more about my first impressions with it.

<!-- more -->

There's lots of nice little touches everywhere in the OS. I keep discovering little shortcuts and ways of doing things. Nothing seems to be too well hidden to find it yourself. For example, I like the way the calculator changes to the scientific layout when the iPhone is landscape oriented. It's all these little things that make using the device such a joy.

### Niggles

There are a few things that niggle me about the phone though. The first is that audio quality during calls doesn't seem to be on par with my old Sony Ericsson. In fact it sounds rather muffled in comparison, even through headphones. I don't know how dependant this is on the phone at the other end as the majority of calls I've taken on it so far are from my wife's K800i. Perhaps iPhone to iPhone calls (or iPhone to other phones) are much clearer? I'll report back when I've had more experience with it.

Although I mentioned that everything is easy to find, one thing really wasn't.  It took me some googling and experimenting before I figured out how to access street view from Maps! I can't help wonder if this would be more intuitive if it worked in a similar way to Google Maps on the desktop browser; drag the little man onto the road.

The email application is very nice, and picked up the two accounts I have setup in Mail on my Mac. What is a bit perplexing is that there doesn't seem to be any way to have a different signature on each account. This is a standard feature in any desktop client (including Apple's Mail) so I don't see why they couldn't extend it to the iPhone.

### Bumper Case

I decided to buy one of Apple's bumper cases for the phone. All the third party ones -- not that there are many around yet -- seem to cover the whole phone, and I didn't want anything getting in the way of that gorgeous display. The case itself is great, it fits the phone well and looks like it should be there. It doesn't provide any direct protection for the glass front and back, but it provides adequate protection for the edges, which are *far* more likely to actually hit something. The glass feels so nice to touch that it would be a shame to cover it up.

The original iPhone had a headphone jack that was recessed into the body, which meant that many headphones would not fit. This spawned a number of adapters from different manufacturers. It would seem that with the bumper case, Apple have replicated that same problem here, with a hole in the case that is not big enough to accept any of my existing headphones. I could have gotten an adapter, but I chose instead to try the [Apple in-ear headphones](http://www.apple.com/uk/ipod/in-ear-headphones/) as an upgrade to my trusty Sennheiser CX400's. Curiously, my wifes CX300's, which are about 2 years newer than my 400's, actually have a narrower jack plug body and as a result they actually fit! I will write more about the Apple in-ears in a future post.
