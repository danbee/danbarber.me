I'm a couple of days late with this but after almost 3 years of work Debian "Sarge" is now stable.  That's one hell of a release cycle!

Debian has been the standard distro on most of our servers since I started here, but the lag between stable releases has caused me to investigate other options in order to get recent packages, although I've been using "Sarge" packages for some time now.
