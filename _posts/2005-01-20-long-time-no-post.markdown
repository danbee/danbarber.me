Well... so far it's been an uneventful 2005 technically.  So far this week I've re-built both my home workstation and my home server (wanted a smaller case for my workstation and the bigger case for my server) and Cypher (the server) is now running dual Athlon MP 1.2Ghz chips on a Tyan Tiger MP.  The dual Celeron 400's on the BP6 were good, but getting a little long in the tooth now.

The other thing is, I could do with finding some new hosting.  Not that I'm unhappy with my current arrangement, it's just that I need to be able to host more than one site so I can move the ones hosted from home.  So... any suggestions for good hosts in the UK would be much appreciated!  I can't use a US one (such as Site5.com) as I have no way of paying for it (they all need Mastercard or Visa y'see).

The last thing to mention is that I'm probably going to re-launch the site with a new design and a new backend (Wordpress in case you hadn't guessed) so that will be soon!  I will endeavour to keep it much more up to date.
