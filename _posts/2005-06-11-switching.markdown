I've been tempted for a long time to "switch", and the reasons just become more and more compelling.  The majority of blogs I read are written by Mac users, OS X just keeps getting better, and the line 'It just works' seems to be more applicable to Mac than Windows these days, which was brought home to me a little with my recent experiences with Bluetooth (expect a post about this).  There's some exciting stuff happening and it seems to be Mac oriented right now.

So, like <a href="http://urbanmainframe.com/folders/blog/20050520/">Jonathan</a>, I may well be buying one soon.  Not a beast like the <a href="http://store.apple.com/Apple/WebObjects/ukstore.woa/91001/wo/RW6vx5OFAsWp2LM3aeNmcsN0ueY/0.0.11.1.0.6.23.1.0.1.0.0.0.1.0">Dual G5 Powermac</a>, but a nice portable <a href="http://store.apple.com/Apple/WebObjects/ukstore.woa/91001/wo/RW6vx5OFAsWp2LM3aeNmcsN0ueY/0.0.11.1.0.6.23.1.1.1.1.0.0.1.0">12" Powerbook</a>.
