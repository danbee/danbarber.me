So far, the one thing that has been bugging the hell out of me with OS X is the mouse control panel.  On Windows I used to just switch the acceleration off altogether, as I'm firmly in the camp that believes the mouse pointer should follow the mouse 1:1.  In fact, I even had a registry hack that disabled mouse acceleration completely, even when the 'Enhance pointer precision' option was checked.  While we're on that subject, who decided on the name of that option anyway?!?

This post was inspired by Michael Heilemanns <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2005/08/19/mastering-your-mouse-in-os-x/">recent mouse related post</a>, and I completely agree that the mouse control panel in OS X seems to lack a lot of the options it needs.  I can understand that Apple probably want it to be simple, so why not include the more advanced controls; acceleration curve etc, behind a button marked 'Advanced'?

<a href="http://www.usboverdrive.com/">Two</a> <a href ="http://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/">solutions</a> appear to be popular, but neither of them support my Apple Bluetooth mouse, and they both cost money.  And it seems ridiculous that third parties have felt the need to write software that fixes something Apple should have fixed.

So come on Apple, give me a decent mouse control panel which will allow me to turn the acceleration off!
