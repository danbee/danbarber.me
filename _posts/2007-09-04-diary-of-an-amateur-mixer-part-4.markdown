This will be the last entry in the diary, as the mix is now done and submitted to the event.

The mix was pretty much done, but there were a few things I wasn't really happy with.  The snare drum sounded a little bit weedy, so I put Ferox on it and whacked the saturation all the way up to 80%. This gave it some grit and snap that it was lacking before and I was happy with the result. I also brought the wind sound up in the mix slightly, and also automated the second lot of wind up in the mix even more so you could just about hear it throughout the middle eight. I also added a stereo widener (Omnisone) to the drum buss and set it to about 150%.

I placed a delay plugin on the distorted vocal that went through the middle eight to take it back in the mix a little as I felt it was a bit prominent.

The automation was tweaked in places. I also added a very small amount of compression to the bass track to help it sit better with the automation.

There was absolutely no 2-buss compression. Only thing on there was Ferox, set to about 20% saturation, just to give the mix a little bit of grit.
