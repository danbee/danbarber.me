I'm not dead.  Just not had a great deal to write about on here.  There is another 'Notes from a Switcher' article in the works, but my plan is to take my time a bit more on this one.  Expect to see it in the next few weeks.

Note: I have noticed that my del.icio.us stuff has stopped working.  I'll get round to fixing it at some point.  <em>(Edit: It seems to be working again now)</em>
