ClockRocket is a bit work in progress at the moment.  So while I am currently in the middle of writing my site skinning tutorial I found that my site needs a bit of work in that department anyway!

Hell I could probably do with bringing the site code more up to date, as it's currently based on MovableType 2 templates which aren't very semantically correct.

Watch this space!
