<p>It would appear that <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/finger/?fid=toddh@idsoftware.com">Doom 3 has gone gold!</a>  The official word from Todd Hollenshead is that it will arrive here in the UK on August 6th.</p>

<blockquote><p>IT'S DONE!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Yes, this is the official word that DOOM 3 has been code released and has been approved for manufacturing! It won't be long now until the anticipation ends and the PH34R begins ;-) We literally just hung up with Activision and have confirmed that our latest release candidate has been mutually approved and is finally GOLD. Thanks to everyone for their patience (yeah right! =) and for everyone at id, Activision and our numerous partners for helping us create what I believe is absolutely the best game we have ever made.</p>

<p>Finally, after all this waiting, prepare to have the crap scared out of you.</p>
