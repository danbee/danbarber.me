Just a few notes in this one today.  I'm still enjoying the Mac OS experience, but I have a few gripes to make.  Mainly things that I'd like to see added, features I've got used to on other systems.

Quicktime 7 is great, streamed video's are sharp and play smoothly with little to no skipping and stuttering.  Just one thing really; Why should I have to pay for Quicktime Pro to be able to play my video's fullscreen?  I can understand why they might want you to pay for features like the ability to create, edit and convert video files (although doesn't iMovie do all that stuff too?).  £20 is quite a lot of money to add a fullscreen feature, especially when I've paid over £1,000 for the machine itself.  Would it really hurt to make Quicktime Pro free?  Or at least make fullscreen a free feature.

I've been playing my music in iTunes, ripping my CD's to AAC (which is great for listening on my mobile phone too) and keeping it all sorted and tagged.  I just wish for a few extra features really.  The ability to play Ogg Vorbis would be extremely nice (as most of my CD's are already ripped to this format), although I'm pretty sure I'll have to resign myself to using another player for that.  Gapless is a no brainer really, live albums, concept albums, mix albums, in fact any album that has tracks that run together (Green Day - American Idiot for example) all need gapless playback for proper listening, and iTunes doesn't do it.  Nor does the iPod.  Big problem.  CD's have been gapless since they were introduced in 1983, Minidisc is gapless, Philips audio cassette is gapless.  Why can't anybody get this one right?  And don't tell me I should rip the CD as one big MP3, that's not good enough.

Last but not least, I would like to be able to sort my albums by year, not by name.  So when I click on Led Zeppelin in my library browser, it would be nice to see the albums listed chronologically, Led Zeppelin I, Led Zeppelin II etc...

I'll be keeping my eye on Dibrom's <a href="http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=34627">Euphonos</a> player as a Foobar2000 like replacement for iTunes.  And I'm using <a href="http://www.lightheadsw.com/xinema.php">Ximema</a> for fullscreen Quicktime playback.

This has been a bit of a rant, thanks for listening.
