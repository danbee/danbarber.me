I've just moved this website over to a Linode VPS. The experience so far has been brilliant. The Linode control panel is excellent and provides all the facilities you could possibly need. I'd decided to move from shared hosting as I felt I was beginning to outgrow it. I needed more flexibility and what better way to get that flexibility than with a virtual machine!
