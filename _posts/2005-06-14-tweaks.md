I've made a few minor changes to the logo, mainly just to clean it up and make it a little more unique.  I've also got a nice blue and green version for a white background, which may get incorporated into a future design.

In 3-4 days Apple Computer Inc should deliver a 12" Powerbook to my door.  Yep, I've placed my order and I'm switching!  Yay!

<strong>Update:</strong> Well... it would appear that the bag I ordered with my Powerbook will take 5 days to ship, thus delaying the order.  So it won't be here as quick as I thought it would be. :(
