[AeroFS](http://aerofs.posterous.com/) is a decentralised file syncing system, similar to Dropbox but without the online storage. Looks very interesting!

> AeroFS is designed to let you go beyond simple file syncing and collaboration. You own devices with vast amounts of storage available (e.g. laptops, desktops), yet you are forced to rely on third party cloud technologies to sync and share files between them. Cloud-based syncing and sharing works well for small personal documents and limited media, but breaks down when we talk about use cases such as:
>
> * Businesses sharing and collaborating on sensitive contracts and documents, where control over your data is truly important
> * Sharing vast amounts of rich media (think hundreds of gigabytes), where cloud storage costs grow rapidly
>
> To address these issues, we've designed AeroFS to be completely decentralized. You can sync files between any two (or more!) devices with or without Internet access, over a LAN, and behind a firewall. Your files do not need to be uploaded to the cloud, so you will retain full control of your data.
