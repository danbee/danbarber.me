I like my <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=gb&lc=en&ver=4000&template=pp1_loader&php=php1_10117&zone=pp&lm=pp1&pid=10117">Sony Ericsson T630</a>, but, as I'm due for an upgrade, I've been scouting round to see what I can get instead.

After a brief flirt with the idea of an <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=gb&lc=en&ver=4000&template=pp1_loader&php=php1_10140&zone=pp&lm=pp1&pid=10140">S700i</a>, I noticed that Sony Ericsson have announced a new model that fits my ideals much better.  I was never keen on the idea of having a phone with moving parts, especially ones that involve some kind of electrical connection.  I remember too well the fiasco with the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/phones/7110/">Nokia 7110</a> and it's wholly unreliable sliding mechanism.

The <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=gb&lc=en&ver=4000&template=pp1_loader&php=php1_10242&zone=pp&lm=pp1&pid=10242">K750i</a> appears to be essentially a <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=gb&lc=en&ver=4000&template=pp1_loader&php=php1_10139&zone=pp&lm=pp1&pid=10139">K700i</a> with a better camera, and a memory stick slot.  The ability to store a couple of albums worth of music on a memory stick seems like a great feature, and I can imagine using this phone to play music on the move.  Also, the memory stick makes having a 2 megapixel camera on the phone a much more viable proposition.

Of course, it helps that I like the styling as well!
