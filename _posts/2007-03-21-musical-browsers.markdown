I've created a [new page on this site, to host all my music](/music/).  Most of what's on there is the stuff I was composing many years ago, but gradually some new things should appear on there.  Hopefully some of it will be quite good!

I've also switched my default browser to [Opera](http://www.opera.com/).  It feels way faster and leaner than Firefox, and so far doesn't seem to be having any trouble with my favourite sites...
