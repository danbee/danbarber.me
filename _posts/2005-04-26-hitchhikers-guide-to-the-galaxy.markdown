<img src="/images/marvin.png" class="alignright" alt="" />The feature film version of Douglas Adams 'Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy' is released this Friday.  It's definately on my 'must-see' list.  I'm a little worried though, as there's just so many ways it could suck.  Having said that, so far the casting looks good; Stephen Fry sounds like an excellent choice for the book, and I'm sure Alan Rickman will play Marvin with just the right amount of disdain.

I'll post a review when I've seen it.
