### Retina MacBook Pro

* 2.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i7
* 8GB 1600MHz memory
* 256GB flash storage
* NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M with 1GB of GDDR5 memory
* 2880x1800 15-inch Glossy Widescreen Display
* Price - **$2,199.00**

### Regular MacBook Pro

* 2.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i7
* 8GB 1600MHz memory
* 256GB Solid State Drive
* NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M with 512MB of GDDR5 memory
* 1440x900 15-inch Glossy Widescreen Display
* Price - **$2,399.00**

That's a $200 dollar difference, in favour of the Retina MacBook Pro! "But Apple charge a premium for their RAM and SSD!" you say. So let's find alternatives...

* Base 15" MacBook Pro - **$1,799.00**
* 8GB 1600MHz memory from Crucial - **$55.99**
* 256GB 256GB Crucial m4 2.5-inch SATA 6Gb/s - **$213.43**
* Total - **$2068.42**

So that is a bit cheaper, but it's only $130 less than a similarly specced Retina MacBook Pro. That $130 gets you four times as many pixels, twice as much video memory and a machine that's over a pound lighter. I think that's a pretty good deal.
