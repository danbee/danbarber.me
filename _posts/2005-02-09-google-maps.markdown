Well, Google have done it again with another killer web app.  <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> is really quite stunning in it's implementation.  It's fast, and the map display is good quality.  You can drag the map about just as you'd expect to be able to, and you can search for almost any company or organisation and it'll pick it out on the map for you.  It doesn't use Flash or Java, in fact I haven't entirely worked out how it works yet.

In short, Google Maps works entirely as you'd expect.  Only trouble is, it currently only covers the United States.  Come on Google, give us UK maps!
