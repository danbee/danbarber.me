My post "[Chess and Recursion: Part
1](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/chess-and-recursion-part-1)" has gone live on
the thoughtbot blog!

> Iâ€™ve been using my investment time at thoughtbot to build a multiplayer chess
> game using Elixir and Phoenix in order to hone my skills in that area. One of
> the trickiest and most fun parts of the project so far has been generating all
> the possible moves for a player to make.
