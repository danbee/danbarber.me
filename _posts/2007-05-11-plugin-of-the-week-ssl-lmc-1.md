*"The SSL Listen Mic Compressor was the secret weapon in many producers sonic arsenal of recording techniques. Originally designed to prevent overloading the return feed from a studio communications mic, its fixed attack and release curves were eminently suitable for use on ambient drums mics. Of course, weâ€™d like to take all the credit for this great sound, but as usual, it was the creativity of SSL users that led to the idea."*

Awesome plugin for getting that really compressed 80's drum sound.  Or turn it right up to get huge crunched drums.
