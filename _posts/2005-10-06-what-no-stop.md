There seems to be an increasing trend for media players (both hardware and software) to leave out the 'stop' button.  They have a 'play/pause' button, 'next' and 'previous' track buttons, but no stop.  iTunes, iPods, and my new iAudio5; none of them have a 'stop' button.  I know the pause button does pretty much the same job, but it's still different.  It's not quite as final 'stop' is it?  It gives the impression that the music will start up again at some point in the future.  What if I don't like what's playing?  What if I just don't want to listen any more?

So come on, stop leaving out the 'stop' button and put it back in it's rightful place.  Next to 'play'.
