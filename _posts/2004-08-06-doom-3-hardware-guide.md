<p>I came across <a href="http://www2.hardocp.com/article.html?art=NjQ0">this article</a> on <a href="http://www.hardocp.com">Hard[OCP]</a> last night.  It should give people a good idea of whether their machine will handle Doom 3 before they buy it.  I was quite surprised myself at how well it ran on my lowely Radeon 9600!  It would appear also that the game still looks curiously stunning at 800x600, with much better framerates than 1024x768.</p>

<p>Hard[OCP] agree:</p>

<blockquote><p>What we noticed immediately is that DOOM 3 looks incredible even at 640x480! And as we increased the resolution, the game began to look more and more like a pre-rendered movie. Visually, DOOM 3 is unlike any other game we have ever seen on the PC. We initially began playing DOOM 3 on the minimum spec system, which consisted of a GeForce4 MX-440 64MB video card at the Low Quality setting and 640x480 resolution. We were literally drawn into the game, and became fully immersed in it at these settings. As we used increasingly faster video cards and were able to raise the resolution, we discovered something interesting that we had never seen before in a game: antialiasing was not necessary.</p></blockquote>
