I had a rather worried sounding message from the friend who's server hosts this site.  He said a script that was part of my site (mt-comments.cgi) was almost bringing the server to its knees fairly regularly. 

So it seems that even with mt-blacklist making it pointless, the mt-comments.cgi script was receiving enough hits to actually slow the whole server down considerably, and it's ironic to think that it was probably a result of mt-blacklist scanning each comment!

Anyway, I've had to disable that file completely now to ease the load on the server, so as a result I've had to turn commenting off completely.  Bummer.  Which means in this case, the comment spammers have beaten me.
