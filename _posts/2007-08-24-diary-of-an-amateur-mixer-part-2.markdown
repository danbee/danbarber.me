The mix is coming along nicely :). I've fixed the bass guitar level in the mix and also arranged the guitar parts in the stereo field and balanced them up somewhat. They're now sitting in the mix much better and not crowding the vocal. I've not felt the need to EQ any of the guitar parts yet as I think they sound great as they are!

On the drum side, I've fiddled with the levels a little here and there, dropping the kick drum in the mix a little and dropping the level of the rim click too as I felt it was a bit overpowering. I also took a feed from the overhead bus and fed it into another track with the SSL Listen Mic compressor on it. Running the two tracks in parallel sounds pretty damn good to my amateur ears!

Now, it may sound like I've replaced that sound that starts before the intro guitar, but it's actually just a phaser plugin and a massive reverb, all wet and no dry. It actually sounds much more like wind and to my mind suits the song better.

For part 2 of my diary I thought it would be a good idea to give a run down of my setup. It's all under the fold though so if you're not interested don't click ;). Plugin list next time...

I'm using a custom built PC (one of my many talents!) with an AMD Athlon 64 X2 dual core CPU and 2gb RAM. This gives me plenty of headroom for plugins, which is nice :).

That outputs to an M-Audio FastTrack Pro USB interface which is connected to Mackie HR624 monitors via balanced connections. I also have a pair of Sennheiser HD280 headphones which, apart from monitoring while recording, I also use to double check the low end (no treatment in my room yet, so I can't really trust the Mackies) and headphone compatibility. My DAW of choice is [Reaper](http://www.reaperaudio.com/).
