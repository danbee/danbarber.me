I've realised recently that I spend far too much time looking at things like Twitter, Hacker News and Reddit. It has become almost an impulse to just load up something bite sized to read whenever I'm waiting on something or when I get to work.

I'm confident it's affecting both my productivity and my creativity so I'm going to try an experiment somewhat inspired by begriffs article [Going "Write-Only"](http://begriffs.com/posts/2015-04-20-going-write-only.html). I'm going to avoid social media and short-form reading for a week (to start). This means no Twitter, Hacker News, Reddit, Arstechnica or any other sources of bite sized information. I will restrict myself to long-form reading like books or articles I've saved to Instapaper (of which I have quite a queue!).

Hopefully after a while the craving for that junk food of information will diminish.
