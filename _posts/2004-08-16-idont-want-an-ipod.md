<p>Ok, so I'd be the first to admit that Apples iPod and iPod Mini are two sexy looking bits of kit, but I'd never buy one.  In response to <a href="http://blog.codefront.net/">Cheah Chu Yeow</a>'s <a href="http://blog.codefront.net/archives/2004/08/09/iwish_ihad_an_ipod_mini.php">post</a> pointing to '<a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-6450_7-5102324-1.html">Five reasons not to buy an iPod</a>', here are my reasons.

<li><h4>It won't play any of my music.</h4><p>I made a conscious choice quite a while ago to encode all of my music in <a href="http://www.vorbis.com/">Ogg Vorbis</a> format, which has some advantages over MP3.  Better quality at the same bitrates, sample granularity for perfect gapless playback, and open source so I know I can always play my music on any platform (at least that's the idea).
