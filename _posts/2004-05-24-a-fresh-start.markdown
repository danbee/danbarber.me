You may have noticed that all of a sudden all the content has dissapeared from this site.  'Why?' you ask?  Well, I figured that I'm a bit fed up of writing about my day to day personal life and I'm sure it can't be that interesting to read either!  

With that in mind, I intend to start producing useful and worthwhile content -- starting with an article on how I achieved the stylesheet switcher, particularly how I  approached the problem of styling the pop up content windows.

Suggestions and comments are all appreciated (except the spammers, they can kiss my...).
