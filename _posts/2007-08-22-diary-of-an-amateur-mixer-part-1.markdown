So I entered the Womb forum [MiLaR](http://womb.mixerman.net/showthread.php?t=4047) event and have started mixing Aces High's track, 'Simple Little Bird'.

I'm going to document my progress here. I'm using [Reaper](http://www.reaperaudio.com/), along with the built in plugs, and I'm limiting myself to free plugins, mostly because that's all I've got, but it also means anyone can download Reaper and the plugins and get the same mix I made (I'll post a full list of the plugins used somewhere near the end of the mix).

I put a rough mix together last night, got everything organised, got the levels fairly balanced, EQ'd a couple of things (Kick drum, vocals), put some compression on the drum overheads, snare and kick, and also on some of the vocal tracks. I also set up some panning in places.

The bass guitar is a little high in the mix right now, and the guitars are a bit lost due to the fact that they're centre panned.

Anyway, you can hear what I've done so far.
