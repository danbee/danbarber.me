I'm selling my DSLR gear to make way for a smaller more compact camera setup. The following items are available. Contact me on sale@danbarber.me if you're interested in any of the items.

Check my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/danbee/) stream for example shots from this gear. Most of the photos on there were taken with the 30D with one of the two lenses listed.

Prices don't include shipping.

### [Canon EOS 30D body](http://www.canon.co.uk/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/Digital_SLR/eos30d/) -- £100

This body is in excellent condition and comes with two batteries, charger, cables and manual. I'll throw in a couple of CF cards too.

### [Sigma EX Macro 18-50mm f2.8 lens](http://www.ephotozine.com/article/sigma-18-50-f-2-8-ex-dc-interchangeable-lens-review-4040) -- £150

In excellent condition, with box and case. This is a great alternative to the usual Canon kit lens as it has a wide f2.8 aperture through the zoom range.

### [Canon L series 70-200 f4 USM lens](http://www.canon.co.uk/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/EF_Lenses/Telephoto_Zoom/EF_70-200mm_f4L_USM/) -- £350

Widely regarded as one of the sharpest lenses Canon makes! This is an amazing lens. In excellent condition with box and lens hood.

### [Canon RS-80N3 remote shutter release](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Canon-Remote-Switch-RS-80-N3/dp/B00007EEA4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1398012676&sr=8-1&keywords=canon+rs+80n3) -- Sold!

Bought new, barely used.
